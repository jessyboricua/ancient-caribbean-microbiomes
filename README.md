# Analysis of Fecal Microbiomes of Ancient Indigenous Cultures from the Caribbean

## Description:
Coprolites are fossilized feces that can be used to provide information on the composition of the intestinal microbiota and diet of the subject. This project will analyse DNA sequenced from human coprolites belonging to the Huecoid and Saladoid ancient cultures from Puerto Rico. While more is known about the Saladoid culture, it is believed that both societies co-existed on this island approximately from 5 to 1170 AD. 

## Dataset
This dataset is comprised of DNA from coprolites that underwent Next Generation Sequencing using metabarcodes targeting 16S rDNA and 18S rDNA libraries. 

## Goals
Using statistical methods, I will determine whether both cultures can be distinguished from each other on the basis of their bacterial and fungal gut microbiomes, and whether parasite loads were heavy and culturally distinct.
