# Analysis of Fecal Microbiomes of Ancient Indigenous Cultures from the Caribbean

## Description:
Coprolites are fossilized feces that can be used to provide information on the composition of the intestinal microbiota and diet of the subject. This project will analyse DNA sequenced from human coprolites belonging to the Huecoid and Saladoid cultures from Puerto Rico. While more is known about the Saladoid culture, it is believed that both societies co-existed on this island approximately from 5 to 1170 AD. For this study, we extracted DNA from the coprolites and conducted metagenomic characterization on the isolated DNA to create our dataset. Using statistical methods, we determine whether both cultures can be distinguished from each other on the basis of their bacterial and fungal gut microbiomes, and whether parasite loads were heavy and culturally distinct.
